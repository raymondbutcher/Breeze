A web site platform using Tornado Web, MongoDB, Bootstrap.

I think the features will fit somewhere between Django and WordPress.

This is largely a learning experience with Tornado and asynchronous apps
in general, but I hope to eventually make this a decent product.

The general plan is to:

1. Make a solid base platform with admin, forms, auth, etc.
2. Develop it to a point where I can create and customize a basic blog
   using pretty much only the platform's interface.
3. Keep enhancing it with any new features and ideas that come up.
