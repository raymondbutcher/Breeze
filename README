A web site platform that will use Tornado Web and MongoDB.

This is largely a learning experience with Tornado and asynchronous apps
in general, but I hope to eventually make this a decent website platform.

The general plan is to:

1. Develop it to a point where I can create and customize a basic blog
   using only the platform's interface.
2. Keep enhancing it with any new features and ideas that come up.

I do not wish to plan anything in-depth at this point, because seeing all
of the requirements in one document would kill my motivation.

Some overall goals include:

* In-page admin interface using JavaScript
 * No admin URL, it's all through the main site
 * Inline editing of everything that is stored in the datase
 * Dialog boxes for editing non-public objects/data
 * Allow building dynamic pages via a JavaScript interface
  * Developing this will be complicated

* Allow flexible lists/feeds of various content types

* Core content types might include:
 * Page
 * Auth (users/groups)
 * Comments ? What about disqus or something?

* Some kind of app/plugin architecture
 * Articles
 * Forums
 * Github (to show latest commits, tickets, etc)
 * Menu
