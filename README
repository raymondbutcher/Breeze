A web site platform that will use Tornado Web and MongoDB.

This is largely a learning experience with Tornado and asynchronous apps
in general, but I hope to eventually make this a decent website platform.

The general plan is to:

1. Develop it to a point where I can create and customize a basic blog
   using only the platform's interface.
2. Keep enhancing it with any new features and ideas that come up.

I do not wish to plan this in-depth at this point, because seeing all of the
requirements in one document would kill my motivation.

Some overall goals include:

* Allow building dynamic pages via a JavaScript interface.
* Allow flexible lists of various content types.
* Allow commenting on everything.
